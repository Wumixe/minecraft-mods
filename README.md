My personal set of Minecraft mods that I use.

I use the Prism Launcher at https://prismlauncher.org/ because it is superior to the bloated and proprietary official launcher. Prism Launcher is open source and has features such as built-in mod and shader management.

I personally prefer Fabric, so here are the mods I use from Modrinth. They are all client-side and I have had no problems with them on servers like Hypixel. You can search all of these up in Prism Launcher, but I will list them here anyway.

- 3D Skin Layers (https://modrinth.com/mod/3dskinlayers) is a mod that makes skin layers three-dimensional, which makes skins much prettier.
- Apple Skin (https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) shows the saturation, hunger, and health you gain from certain foods.
- Fabric API (https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is just an API required for these mods to work.
- Sodium (https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) improves rendering performance.
- Lithium (https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) goes hand-in-hand with Sodium and improves game logic performance.

I like the vanilla look of the game, so I use the Vanilla Tweaks (https://vanillatweaks.net) texture pack. It's made by Xisumavoid, a member of the Hermitcraft SMP, and it's great. It lets you select tons of changes you want that improve the game's look without changing it. My configuration file is a .txt that you can just drop into the site and change how you please.

You can also use the "custom-splashes" texture pack in this repo and replace the text in "splashes.txt" with whatever you like for custom splash messages in the game.

That's all I do for Minecraft. I don't really like shaders, but if you do, I recommend using Iris (https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) and Complementary Reimagined (https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined).

Thanks for looking at my settings for goofy block game. I slapped MIT license on this so you can use it however you want (but I don't know why you would want this lol).
